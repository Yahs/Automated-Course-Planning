# Automated-Course-Planning
The senior design project to work on making the course planning of semester based on the degree requirements and degree planning.
This project is worked on Ruby on Rails and all the frontend UI style is done using the HTML and CSS and bootstrap. The backend for the algorithm to find proper class schedule the following algorithms are used:
- Breath First Search
- Topological Sort Graph
- Binary Tree
- Priority Queues
- Adjacency Matrix

The algorithm was supported using arraylist and hashmap.The hashmap was used to find the class name and their prefix and the data stored in the hashmap is dynamic as it gets reloaded from CSV files on every command to start the rails project.

The final product will help the students of Computer Science and Software Engineering of Florida Tech to get the multiple class schedule before meeting their professors and register for next semester.
